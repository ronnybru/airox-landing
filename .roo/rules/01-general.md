## Founder's Vision

ðŸ’¡ **Why I Built This â€” Ronny Bruknapp, Founder of airox**

I poured thousands of dollars into API access and spent years fine-tuning how to code with AIâ€”not just alongside it. I started learning to code one year before GPT-4 dropped, giving me a front-row seat to this revolution. airox is the result of obsession, battle-tested workflows, and a belief that LLMs aren't just toolsâ€”they're teammates. This is the framework I wish existed when I started. Now it's yours.

# Development Guidelines

## General Principles

- Prefer Server Actions for data mutations (Next.js App Router)
- Use server-side data fetching with Suspense for improved performance and UX
- Keep solutions simple without over-complicating
- We are in prelaunch state - optimize for best schema and database setup without migration concerns

## Frontend Development

### Components

- Use shadcn/ui components when they fit the requirements
- Create custom components from scratch when shadcn/ui components don't meet specific needs
- Use the custom typography components from `components/ui/typography.tsx` for consistent text styling

### Typography

Import typography components from `components/ui/typography.tsx`:

```tsx
import { H1, H2, Paragraph, Muted } from "@/components/ui/typography";

// Usage
<H1>Page Title</H1>
<H2>Section Title</H2>
<Paragraph>Regular paragraph text</Paragraph>
<Muted>Small muted text</Muted>
```

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the project's color scheme and design system
- Use CSS variables for theme colors

### TypeScript Types

Organize TypeScript types using a hybrid approach:

- **Use Drizzle-Generated Types for Database Entities**:

  - Leverage Drizzle ORM's type generation for database entities
  - Import these types directly from the schema files
  - Example: `import type { User } from "@/lib/db/schema"`
  - Do not duplicate types that are already defined by Drizzle

- **Centralized Types Directory**:

  - Create a dedicated `types/` directory at the root level
  - Organize by domain/feature (e.g., `types/auth.ts`, `types/notifications.ts`)
  - Include index files for easier imports
  - Use for types that aren't directly tied to database entities

- **Co-located Types**:

  - For component-specific types, define them in the same file as the component
  - For complex components, create a separate `[component-name].types.ts` file in the same directory

- **API Types**:
  - Create a `types/api/` subdirectory for API-related types
  - Define request/response types for each API endpoint
  - Use consistent naming: `[Resource][Action]Request` and `[Resource][Action]Response`
  - Reuse Drizzle types where appropriate rather than redefining them

Example implementation:

```typescript
// types/index.ts (barrel file for easy imports)
export * from "./auth";
export * from "./notifications";
// etc.

// types/auth.ts
export interface User {
	id: string;
	name: string;
	email: string;
	role: UserRole;
	// etc.
}

export type UserRole = "user" | "admin";

// types/api/notifications.ts
export interface CreateNotificationRequest {
	userId?: string;
	organizationId?: string;
	type: NotificationType;
	title: string;
	message: string;
	// etc.
}
```

Import conventions:

```typescript
// Prefer importing from barrel files
import { User, Session } from "@/types";

// For specific imports when needed
import { CreateNotificationRequest } from "@/types/api/notifications";
```

## Backend Development

### Database

- Use Drizzle ORM for database operations
- PostgreSQL is the primary database
- Follow the schema structure in `lib/db/schema.ts`
- Add relations between tables using Drizzle's relations API

### Server Actions

- Create server actions in the `app/actions/` directory
- Use typed inputs and outputs for better type safety
- Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate error messages

### Data Fetching

- Prefer fetching data on the server in Server Components
- Use React Suspense for loading states with `async`/`await` directly in components
- Implement parallel data fetching when possible to improve performance
- For client-side data fetching needs, use SWR or React Query with proper error handling

## Authentication and Session Management

### Server Components & Server Actions

Use the helpers in `lib/session.ts` to access the session:

```typescript
import {
	getServerSession,
	requireServerSession,
	getCurrentUserId,
	getActiveOrganization,
} from "@/lib/session";

// Get the session (returns null if not authenticated)
const session = await getServerSession();

// Get the session and throw error if not authenticated
const session = await requireServerSession();

// Get just the user ID
const userId = await getCurrentUserId();

// Get the active organization
const activeOrg = await getActiveOrganization();
```

### Client Components

Use the hooks from `lib/auth-client.ts` for client components:

```typescript
import { useSession, useActiveOrganization } from "@/lib/auth-client";

// Access session in client component
const { data: session } = useSession();

// Access active organization in client component
const { data: activeOrg } = useActiveOrganization();
```

## Email System

- Use the email templates in `app/emails/templates/`
- Use the `renderTemplate` function to render templates with data
- Use the `sendEmail` function to send emails

```typescript
import { renderTemplate } from "@/app/emails/render-template";
import { sendEmail } from "@/app/emails";

const html = await renderTemplate("template-name", {
	name: "User Name",
	// other variables
});

await sendEmail({
	to: "user@example.com",
	subject: "Email Subject",
	html,
});
```

## Notification System

Use the notification functions to send notifications to users or organizations:

```typescript
import {
	createNotification,
	createOrganizationNotification,
} from "@/lib/notifications";

// User notification
await createNotification({
	userId: "user-id",
	type: "info",
	title: "Notification Title",
	message: "Notification message",
});

// Organization notification
await createOrganizationNotification({
	organizationId: "org-id",
	singleReadDismissal: true,
	type: "info",
	title: "Organization Notification",
	message: "This is for all organization members",
});
```

## Cron System and Background Jobs

### Cron Jobs

- Define cron jobs in `config/cron-jobs.ts`
- Implement job handlers in `app/api/cron/` directory
- Use the node-cron syntax for scheduling

```typescript
// Example cron job definition
{
  path: "/api/cron/job-name",
  schedule: "0 0 * * *", // Daily at midnight
  description: "Job description",
  enabled: true
}
```

### Background Jobs with BullMQ

- Use BullMQ for processing background jobs
- Create job queues and processors in appropriate files
- Use Redis for job storage

## Welcome Email Series

- The welcome email series sends three onboarding emails over a week
- Uses BullMQ for scheduling delayed emails
- Supports A/B testing with two variants

```typescript
import { startWelcomeEmailSeries } from "@/app/actions/welcome-emails";

// Start welcome email series for a user
await startWelcomeEmailSeries(userId);
```

# Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages
2. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript types for all functions and components
3. **Performance**: Optimize database queries and use caching where appropriate
4. **Security**: Validate all user inputs and use proper authentication checks
5. **Testing**: Write tests for critical functionality
6. **Documentation**: Document complex functions and components
7. **Code Organization**: Follow the project's directory structure and naming conventions
