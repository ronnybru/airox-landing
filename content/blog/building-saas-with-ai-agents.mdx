The more detailed your requirements, the more effectively the AI agent can assist you.

<Callout type='warning'>
	While AI agents are powerful, they're not mind readers. The quality of your
	instructions directly impacts the quality of the generated code. Be specific
	about your requirements and preferences.
</Callout>

### Step 2: Choose Your Tech Stack (15 minutes)

Select the technologies that best suit your SaaS application. Common choices include:

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express/Next.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, Laravel
- **Frontend**: React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL
- **Authentication**: Auth0, Firebase Auth, custom JWT
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe, PayPal, Lemon Squeezy
- **Hosting**: Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Google Cloud

Communicate your chosen stack to the AI agent, or ask for recommendations based on your requirements.

### Step 3: Generate Project Boilerplate (1 hour)

Now it's time to leverage your AI agent to create the initial project structure:

1. Ask the agent to generate the project setup commands
2. Request a comprehensive folder structure
3. Have the agent create configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
4. Generate environment variable templates
5. Set up the database connection and ORM configuration

Example prompt for the AI agent:

```
"I need to create a SaaS application using Next.js with TypeScript for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL with Prisma as the ORM. The app will be a project management tool with user authentication, team collaboration, and subscription billing via Stripe. Please generate the initial project structure and configuration files."
```

### Step 4: Implement Authentication System (1 hour)

Authentication is critical for any SaaS application. Have your AI agent:

1. Generate user models and database schemas
2. Create signup, login, and password reset functionality
3. Implement JWT or session-based authentication
4. Set up role-based access control
5. Create protected routes and middleware

### Step 5: Develop Core Backend Features (2 hours)

Focus on the backend logic that powers your SaaS:

1. Define and create database models for your core entities
2. Generate migration scripts
3. Implement API endpoints with proper validation
4. Create service layers for business logic
5. Set up background jobs or cron tasks if needed
6. Implement error handling and logging

<Callout type='info'>
	AI agents excel at generating CRUD operations and API endpoints. Provide clear
	entity relationships and validation rules to get the most accurate code.
</Callout>

### Step 6: Build the Frontend Interface (2 hours)

With the backend in place, move on to the user interface:

1. Generate page layouts and navigation components
2. Create forms for data input with validation
3. Implement dashboard views and data visualization
4. Build user settings and profile management pages
5. Design responsive layouts for mobile and desktop

Example prompt for the AI agent:

```
"I need a responsive dashboard for my project management SaaS. It should include a sidebar navigation, a main content area showing project cards, and a header with user profile dropdown. The design should follow Material UI principles and use a blue/gray color scheme."
```

### Step 7: Implement Payment Processing (1 hour)

Monetization is key for any SaaS. Have your AI agent:

1. Integrate with payment providers (e.g., Stripe)
2. Create subscription plans and pricing tiers
3. Implement checkout flows
4. Set up webhook handlers for payment events
5. Create billing management interfaces

### Step 8: Testing and Debugging (1 hour)

Quality assurance is crucial even for rapid development:

1. Ask the AI to generate unit tests for critical components
2. Have the agent review the code for potential bugs
3. Test authentication flows and payment processing
4. Verify API endpoints with sample requests
5. Fix any issues that arise during testing

### Step 9: Deployment Setup (1 hour)

Prepare your application for production:

1. Generate deployment configuration files
2. Set up CI/CD pipelines
3. Configure environment variables for production
4. Implement security best practices
5. Create database backup strategies

### Step 10: Documentation and Final Touches (30 minutes)
